BusinessInfoProject
===================

This IOS mobile project enables user to find store/business establishment nearest to their location. 
They can also find the exact location using Google map.
By clikcing on the Store name, the marker will pin to the location map indicating the city, state and location coordinates
provided by the web service.

I have integrated a Google Map SDK for this project that used in the map.
I have also used XML parser for parsing XML data return by the Web service.

The store / business information are displayed in the table. The table being used is scrollable for
a tendency of dynamic change such as addition and deletion of data coming from the web service.

The tools I used to develop this project are Objective C as for the programming language and XCode for IDE.
